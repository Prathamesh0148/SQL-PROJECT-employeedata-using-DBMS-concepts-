Database Structure and Data:
Tables:

The database Project contains two tables: EmployeeDetails and ProjectDetail.
EmployeeDetails holds information about employees, including their ID, name, salary, joining date, department, and gender.
ProjectDetail associates employees with projects, indicating the project each employee is working on.
Data Insertion:

Data has been inserted into both tables to simulate employee and project information.
Employee Information Analysis:
Basic Queries:

Simple queries like SELECT * FROM EmployeeDetails provide an overview of employee details.
Basic filtering using WHERE clause, e.g., SELECT FirstName FROM EmployeeDetails.
String Manipulation:

String manipulation using functions like UPPER, LOWER, CONCAT, and TRIM for modifying and cleaning data.
Concatenating first and last names for a more informative representation.
Pattern Matching:

Utilizing pattern matching with LIKE for flexible queries, such as filtering names starting with 'A' or ending with 'h'.
Date Manipulation:

Converting and formatting dates using CONVERT and FORMAT functions.
Extracting specific date components like year and month using YEAR and MONTH.
Aggregation:

Aggregating data using functions like SUM, AVG, MAX, MIN, and COUNT.
Grouping data by department and calculating total salary for each department.
Project Information Analysis:
Joins and Relationships:

Joining EmployeeDetails and ProjectDetail tables to associate employees with projects.
NULL Handling:

Using COALESCE to handle NULL values, providing default values when necessary.
Data Modification:

Updating and altering tables by adding a new column to the Products table.
Advanced Analysis:
Top N Records:

Retrieving the top N records using SELECT TOP N or LIMIT.
Date Difference:

Calculating date differences using DATEDIFF to determine the time an employee has been working.
Conditional Aggregation:

Using conditional statements within aggregations, like finding the average salary per department.
Cross Join:

Demonstrating a cross join to combine all records from both tables.
Window Functions:

Employing window functions like LAG to analyze fuel consumption trends over time.
String Aggregation:

Utilizing STRING_AGG for concatenating values into a single string, useful for aggregating employee names in a project.
Case Statements:

Implementing CASE statements for conditional transformations.
Miscellaneous:
Random Selection:

Selecting random records using functions like RAND().
Row Comparison:

Comparing rows within a table, such as comparing fuel consumption over consecutive dates.
